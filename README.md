### (read as note-nogram)
Chill analog-styled picross game made with [Butano](http://https://github.com/GValiente/butano) for [GBA Jam 2022](http://https://itch.io/jam/gbajam22), with some gameplay elements inspired by Battle Picross by Sean Reid.

## Features (WIP, subject to change):
* 12 original 12x12 picross puzzles to solve
* fancy jazz/bossanova module music not made by me
* possible story mode that will put one's strategy skills to the test
* maybe a tutorial mode that explains various solving strategies
* creator mode that allows making puzzles and sharing them via GBA save files (notenogram.sav)
* original character cameos of some sort?

## Main game controls:
* **A button** - color the square the pen cursor is pointing at (mark as "on")/confirm option
* **B button** - cross out the square (mark as "off")/exit menu
* **D-pad** - move the pen cursor (*hint: pressing and holding a directional key while holding A or B will mark otherwise empty squares as either "on" or "off" in the selected direction*)
* **Start (in play mode)** - exit puzzle screen
* **Start (in creator mode)** - write current puzzle to SRAM (at least one square should be colored in order to count the pattern as a puzzle)
* **L or R button (in creator mode)** - toggle custom puzzle slots in SRAM to write to (note that since there are currently three slots only, writing to already filled slots will overwrite them)
