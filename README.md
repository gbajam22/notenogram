Chill analog-styled picross game made with [Butano](http://https://github.com/GValiente/butano) for [GBA Jam 2022](http://https://itch.io/jam/gbajam22).

Features (WIP, subject to change):
* 12 original 12x12 picross puzzles to solve
* fancy jazz/bossanova module music not made by me
* possible story mode that will put one's strategy skills to the test
* maybe a tutorial mode that explains various solving strategies
* creator mode that allows making puzzles and sharing them via GBA save files
* original character cameos
